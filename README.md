# KrenAi_Task
This is an assessment given by KrenAI. I developed this mobile app using react native.

# To Run application in debug mode, follow below command
- npm install
- npx expo start -> Press a (Expo Application should be installed in phone)
- or run npm start

# For installing debug app in mobile rather than expo app, follow below
- npx expo run:android (it will create android folder bundle in your project)
# then from next time you can run
- npx react-native run-android (for debug mode)
